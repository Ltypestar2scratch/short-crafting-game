This is a simple element game where you can click a element in a sidebar and drag it out. Can you find all elements without cheating? Go to [this link](https://ltypestar2scratch.github.io/short-crafting-game/) to find out for yourself.
# How you can play it
Basically you click a element in the sidebar and drag the element **outside the sidebar** (or else it will be deleted), then if you click another element and drag them to your first element, if the recipe exists, it will merge them and it will create a new element. That's basically the game.
